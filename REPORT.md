2. Git Tags

Definition:
A git tag is a pointer to a commit, often used to mark versions.

Why useful:
Tags help identify stable versions and checkpoints in history.

Simple vs Annotated:

Simple tag: Just a commit reference.

Annotated tag: Stores metadata (tagger, date, message) and is preferred for releases.

3. Purpose of GitHub Release

Why create a release?
Releases provide downloadable versions of the project for users.

Why attach binaries?
